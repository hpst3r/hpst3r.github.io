### About me

I'm a computer science student from Connecticut. Don't expect me to post my headshot here. My Github profile picture is as much as you'll get without seeing me in person.

I spend my free time as a voluntary Linux herder and amateur stuff-breaker. For the most up-to-date log of what I'm actually doing, check my posts here or my Github profile.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, I'm reachable:
- by [email](mailto:contact@wporter.org)
- on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-porter-631016224/)
- or, for anything informal, on Discord (Hipster#1044).

### About the site

This site was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator that allows me to use git to commit markdown to the web, instead of doing anything that makes sense (like using a CMS.)

The theme I'm using is a simplified (read: desecrated) fork of Lukas Joswiak's [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch). The git repository used to build this site is [here](https://github.com/hpst3r/etch).
