<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>My second pair of Takstar Pro 82 (well, a gaming headset version of them) have a rattly right driver and the strain relief on the cable is no longer relieving strain, so I figured I&rsquo;d try out some open backs before I tried to fix them (driver swap into my original Pro 82s with blown drivers thanks to a Schiit Magni&rsquo;s death.)</p>
<h2 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h2>
<p>Planars = good bass
Bass = good
:. planars = good.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend more than $100 ish on a pair of headphones, and the HE400se are about $110. So I bought the HE400se.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-setup">Comparison Setup</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m A/Bing these HE400se against a version of the Takstar Pro 82 that are essentially always in the &lsquo;bass slider half open&rsquo; mode, DT770s, and Dynaudio BM10 speakers. Source is Spotify at maximum quality (~320kbps).</p>
<p>The DT770s and Takstars are driven by a Schiit Magni Heresy + Modi 3+ combo. The HE400se and speakers are driven off a Sansui AU-G77XII integrated amp running off the preamp out of the Schiit Magni (I felt like the HE400se sound <em>A LOT</em> less tinny  when on the Sansui - its headphone output is fed by the main amp, which is capable of 110wpc/40wpc Class A into 8 ohms if I remember correctly.)</p>
<h1 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h1>
<h2 id="sound-signature">Sound Signature</h2>
<p>Arguably the most important contributor to a pair of &lsquo;good headphones.&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t like these. They sound hollow. Bass rolls off, highs sound muffled. When I first pulled them out of the box and played Soundgarden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Burden In My Hand&rdquo;, I wondered why it sounded like I was standing behind Chris Cornell and watching him sing at a wall. An EQ on the low end helps, but anything substantial seemed to make these sound loose and uncontrolled on most older tracks (lower quality masters), which surprised me.</p>
<p>I could never manage to make these sound engaging. EQing them to attempt to raise the low end never made them sound more than flat, and I couldn&rsquo;t get vocals to sound consistently good without some songs becoming shouty or making some voices sound unnaturally boosted.</p>
<p>The vocals, though.. there&rsquo;s no saving the vocals. On <em>almost</em> every track I listened to, it sounded as if the vocalist was distant and facing the wrong way.</p>
