## Done. Finally.

Took a month and a bit at around ~3 hrs a day, longer than expected because of inefficient study (working on it) and a handful of personal things (stuff happens). Learned a decent amount thanks to hands-on practice (mostly self-made labs in GNS3).

I enjoyed playing with routers and switches much more than just reading about WLC configuration or Cisco SDA. Looking forward to dumping some time into ENARSI study, though that'll probably wait until next year at the earliest (more like 'in two years, after ENCOR and some work experience') unless networking becomes my 'thing'.

## Next Steps

A weekend off, and then I'll be back to work. Haven't quite decided if I'll pour my time into the RHCSA or AZ-104 next. AZ-104 probably looks better on my entry-level resume, but the RHCSA is more up my alley.

Or I might just play with Ansible for now. Cert studying is taking up time that could be spent learning automation. Not sure how I feel about that.

Anyway, I'm happy the CCNA isn't dangling over my head anymore. That's it for now.
