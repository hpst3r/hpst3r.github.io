### About me

I'm a computer science student from Connecticut. I spend my free time as a voluntary Linux herder and amateur stuff-breaker. For the most up-to-date log of what I'm actually doing, check my posts here or my Github profile.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, I'm reachable:

### About the site

Content is my own and may be opinionated. This is not intended to be anything serious. Take everything with at least one grain of salt; I don't have a CCIE and I make mistakes.

This site was made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Yes, I know the content is all offset to the right a little. Yes, I'm going to fix it. Probably.

The theme I'm using is a simplified (read: desecrated) fork of Lukas Joswiak's [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch). The git repository used to build this site is [here](https://github.com/hpst3r/etch).
