    </header><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I took and passed my N+ with around an 800 on 12/21/2023. I spent about thirty hours explicitly studying for the Net+ and taking practice tests, over the course of about a week. Here&rsquo;s what I thought of it, and what I learned.</p>
<h3 id="study-material">Study Material</h3>
<p>I used Jason Dion&rsquo;s practice tests and made flashcards. No official study material and I didn&rsquo;t follow a prep book.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>The Net+ isn&rsquo;t the most difficult test in the world, and success with it does not depend on having a comprehensive understanding of networking (routing isn&rsquo;t covered well.) That isn&rsquo;t to say that it&rsquo;s the easiest test I&rsquo;ve ever taken, or that it&rsquo;s meaningless.</p>
<h3 id="general-knowledge">General Knowledge</h3>
<p>The content covered by the Net+ is mostly general networking fare, perhaps half of what you&rsquo;d see on a CCNA(?). You are not expected to configure network devices, which is the main differentiator between the Net+ and Cisco exams.</p>
<p>For a general idea of the type of understanding I think a Net+ implies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to know the difference between the various 802.11 standards off the top of your head
<ul>
<li>will an 802.11g device connect to an 802.11n access point?</li>
<li>What about an 802.11a device?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the theoretical maximum bandwidth of WiFi 6?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What 802.* standard is PoE? PoE+?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a VLAN?</li>
<li>Some &ldquo;semi-practical&rdquo; questions:
<ul>
<li>what&rsquo;s a port configured as a VLAN trunk&rsquo;s purpose (and limitations)?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s a RADIUS server, and which wireless security protocol makes use of it?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the most secure way to configure a wireless network that doesn&rsquo;t make use of a centralized AA server?</li>
<li>What are common types of DNS records?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the standard size of an Ethernet frame?
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s a runt, what&rsquo;s a giant?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What type of network would you make use of jumbo frames in?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that these are <em>not</em> exam questions or like exam questions. These were taken from my flashcards created before I took the exam - I am not permitted.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think this baseline, definition-based knowledge is all important, and I cannot take issue with the Net+ covering it.</p>
<p>You cannot efficiently troubleshoot a connectivity issue if you don&rsquo;t know DHCP, DNS or APIPA exist and I realize that the Net+ is targeted squarely at entry-level professionals attempting to secure a badge showing that they have at least an entry-level understanding of common networking protocols and at least some kind of idea of how a network goes together (like me!).</p>
<h3 id="asterisks-pbqs">Asterisks (PBQs)</h3>
<p>The PBQs were a big question mark when I came in to sit for my exam. I used Jason Dion&rsquo;s practice exams (Udemy, $15 purchase) to prep for the test. They did not have PBQs, and the &lsquo;simulated&rsquo; PBQ style questions provided were not very accurate (I expected this going in, but this still meant I&rsquo;d never seen one before.)</p>
<p>Being as general as possible to abide by the candidate agreement, you do <em>not</em> need to be familiar with any command line interface to give the Net+ a shot. Just remember that &lsquo;<code>man man</code>&rsquo; is the solution to all your problems. You&rsquo;ll do just fine if you have the knowledge required to pass the rest of the exam. Each question is fairly limited in scope but might catch you off guard - don&rsquo;t necessarily pay attention to all the materials provided.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h3>
<p>I feel like I came away from this exam with a slightly improved personal glossary. I could not list off what 802.11a meant beforehand, and I can now. However, preparing for this cert did not expose me to much &ldquo;networking&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="what-i-disliked">What I Disliked</h4>
<p>I do not feel that the Net+ tests more than an elementary understanding of networking and adjacent technologies. I am notably disappointed in the absence of L3, though I suppose an in-depth understanding of routing isn&rsquo;t strictly necessary for an entry-level IT professional.</p>
<h4 id="the-real-conclusion">The Real Conclusion</h4>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m rather disappointed that I spent the time and money on the Net+. Questions weren&rsquo;t all well thought out and the knowledgebase it covers was rather limited. Instead of putting my resources into the Net+, I feel like I should have used the time and money to get at least partway into a CCNA (though I would certainly not be able to finish it in 30 hours) as it would have probably been both a better resume item <em>and</em> a more effective learning experience.. although, since I feel somewhat like a saltwater fish in a freshwater pond when dropped into a Cisco CLI, perhaps labbing through the pain will be a summer project.</p>
