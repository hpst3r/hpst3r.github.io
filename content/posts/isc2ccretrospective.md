## Introduction

Cert #2 down! I took and passed my CC on December 28th, 2023. I spent something like 12-16 solid hours studying (running through the official course's text content, reading the video transcripts, taking notes, and going through a small set of flash cards) over the course of three days. Here's what I think.

## The Course, The Price

The CC is, like the Net+ I took before it, mostly a memorization exercise. I paid $0 to take it because of ISC²'s "One Million Certified" program, which, as of the time of writing, offers the official learning material and an exam voucher for free (the only cost involved in getting certified is your first year's ISC membership fee.) The learning material they provide is of notably high quality - I didn't notice a single typo outside of the video transcripts, in stark contrast to unnamed unofficial CompTIA study guides provided for not-free (and the Network+ exam itself.) Content was in clear, concise English, and I never found myself wanting in that regard. Situational descriptions made sense, and overall the course felt like a decent product, if a bit brief.

The course consists of videos and articles, chapter assessments and a pre- and post-course assessment (though the assessments were much easier than the actual exam.) There are no 'lab' style questions on the certification exam and there are no 'lab' scenarios in the official prep course; this is entirely a multiple choice exam and the study material only requires memorization. To 'study,' I read articles and video transcripts and took notes on most of the content (whatever I thought was important.) I did this just to make sure that I was actually reading the course and not just mashing my tab key to get through it.

Looking back, I'd say that the official course should mostly prepare you for the exam. If this is your first exposure to cybersecurity, I would highly recommend spending extra time going over and beyond the course material to ensure you have a robust understanding of the concepts the CC covers - the exam may throw you some curveballs that were not explicitly covered by the ISC course, which is the only thing I can knock the course for. You should have a general understanding of networking and at least some experience with cybersecurity if you expect to take and comfortably pass the exam with only a few hours of study under your belt.

Topics covered by the course:

1. Security Principles
    - vocabulary
        - risk management
        - types of controls
        - ISC code of conduct
        - governance
2. Business Continuity
    - BC, disaster recovery, and incident response
    - "What are these" and "What should you think of doing"
3. Access Controls
    - types of physical, logical access controls
    - best practices (separation of duties, providing least privilege)
4. Network Security
    - basic networking concepts - VLANs, TCP/IP model, IP, ports
    - administrative concepts - what's a MSP, what's a SLA, $(thing)aaS(es)
5. Security Operations
    - stresses the importance of keeping things updated
    - types of encryption
    - best practice for handling logging

I would expect a holder of the CC to be able to deliver a high level summary of most things listed above.

I can't say I disliked the CC. The ISC² website, where the course material is hosted, is inoffensively designed and easy to use, and the course (and exam) were free (I would have paid for the Security+ if this was not the case). I scored a 93% on the pre-course assessment, a 94% on the post-course assessment, and, while you are not given your official score, would conservatively estimate that I scored somewhere around an 85% on the certification exam.

## The Test

The CC certification exam is composed of multiple-choice questions. You are not allowed to go back to questions at all; you have one chance to answer or skip any given question. I did not know of this beforehand and I'm a little upset that I probably lost points by speeding through the first handful of questions. Otherwise, the certification examination is fairly straightforward - as previously mentioned, there are no performance-based ('lab') questions, and there's no going back.

Many questions are of the "best answer" sort, where two or three plausible solutions are put forth, but one is clearly more relevant or should be considered "best." Many of the questions were much broader in scope than those asked in the pre- and post-course assessments provided by ISC² to the point where I would not have been confident about passing the exam had I *only* taken the course with no prior experience with cybersecurity, networking or IT.

## Conclusion

Overall? Not too bad. I didn't learn anything in particular but my vocabulary received another OTA update. I wouldn't have gotten the CC if it wasn't free, and wouldn't advise getting it if it ever winds up costing as much as the Sec+.

Additionally, the CC also seems to be a bit lighter on content than the Cisco CCST Cybersecurity (Certified Support Technician - Cybersecurity), which is only $125. I would also keep that product in mind if the cost of the Sec+ is a concern and you're not pursuing government roles (just an additional item for your resume.)

I'm not looking at cybersecurity roles, so I'll take the CC and save my money.
