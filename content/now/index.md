Saw [Jamie Tanna's /now page](https://www.jvt.me/now/) and liked the idea.

## What exactly am I doing?

Upd: Feb 12, 2024

### Goals

**Short-term:**

CCNA (planning on being done before the end of Feb, after about a month of study and too much labbing.. not enough routing to satisfy me, though it's definitely helping me resolve some weak spots in R&Switching at the conceptual level.)

**Medium-term:**

RHCSA or AZ-104 or AWS AZ-104 equivalent.. I want the RHCSA to say I'm a 'certified linux administrator' but the AZ-104 will probably do more to get me a job

### Interests

- Sim racing
- Fast computers
- Linux & open source software
- Bulleted lists

### Hardware & Software

What kind of junk am I running now?

1. Desktop
    - $350 ThinkStation P520 build (bought 2023)
        - Xeon W-2140B, AMD 5700xt, 4x32gb
        - Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021 (21H2)
        - Fedora 39 (GNOME)
2. Laptop
    - ThinkPad T14 G2a (2023)
        - R7 5850u, 2x16gb
        - Fedora 39 (GNOME+Wayland)
3. Phone
    - Pixel 6a (2022)
        - Tensor G1, 6gb
        - Google Android 15
4. Peripherals
    - Monitors
        - Dell P2418d x3 (1440p 24")
            - These are a good balance of size and resolution for me. 120ppi is sharp enough and looks decent while being usable without any scaling at the OS level. Also provides a lot of screen real estate with a small footprint. I use these off my laptop most of the time.
        - Dell S2722QC x1 (4k 27")
            - Unused the majority of the time because non-xorg scaling is painful & stuff often looks worse than it would on a 1440p screen (when xwayland apps are upscaled)
            - Pretty monitor though
    - Keyboard
        - $60 GMK87 build: Akko Cream Blue Pro tactile switches and keycaps off an old Niz electrocapacitive (fancy membrane/offbrand topre) TKL
    - Mouse
        - Razer Basilisk X Hyperspeed - not playing FPS games often anymore so I don't mind the weight.

I also have other stuff.. lab gear, mostly.

Switches:

- Cisco 3560v2s
- ProCurve 1810 and 2810s

Computers:

- ThinkStation(s)
    - E32 (H87, LGA 1150) x6 - used for everything
    - C30 (C602, dual LGA 2011) x1 - not really used much, too slow and draws too much power
    - P710 (C612, dual LGA 2011-3) x1 - network stuff
    - P520 (C422, single LGA 2066) x1 - whatever rig, has a good high-wattage PSU
- Dells
    - T5810 (C612, single LGA 2011-3) x2 - cheap high core count + low power platforms. I should have bought more

Configs and operating systems change very frequently on most of these machines. As of Feb 2024, the P710 is running Proxmox, the t5810s are running ESXi and Fedora Server, and the E32s are running ESXi (x2), Debian (as a hypervisor, x2), Windows Server (x1), and nothing (x1).
