## Introduction

Cert #2 down! I took and passed my CC on December 28th, 2023. I spent something like 12-16 solid hours studying (running through the official course's text content, reading the video transcripts, taking notes, and going through a small set of flash cards) over the course of three days. Here's what I think.

## The Course, The Price

The CC is, like the Net+ I took before it, mostly a memorization exercise. I paid $0 to take it because of ISC²'s "One Million Certified" program, which, as of the time of writing, offers the official learning material and an exam voucher for free. The learning material was of notably high quality - I didn't notice a single typo outside of the video transcripts. Content was in clear, concise English, and I never found myself wanting in that regard. Situational descriptions made sense, and overall the course felt well-made, if a bit brief.

The course consists of videos and articles, chapter assessments and a pre- and post-course assessment (though the assessments were much easier than the actual exam.) There are no 'lab' style questions on the certification exam and there are no 'lab' scenarios in the official prep course; this is entirely a multiple choice exam and the study material only requires memorization. To 'study,' I read articles and video transcripts and took notes on most of the content (whatever I thought was important.) I did this just to make sure that I was actually reading the course and not just mashing my tab key to get through it.

Looking back, I'd say that the official course should mostly prepare you for the exam. If this is your first exposure to cybersecurity, I would highly recommend spending extra time going over and beyond the course material to ensure you have a robust understanding of the concepts the CC covers - the exam may throw you some curveballs that were not explicitly covered by the prep course, which is the only thing I can knock the course for. You should have a general understanding of networking and at least some experience with cybersecurity if you expect to take and comfortably pass the exam with only a few hours of study under your belt.

I can't say I disliked the CC. The ISC² website, where the course material is hosted, is inoffensively designed and easy to use, and the course (and exam) were free (I would have paid for the Security+ if this was not the case). I scored a 93% on the pre-course assessment, a 94% on the post-course assessment (brushed up on one or two vocabulary words), and, while you are not given your official score, would conservatively estimate that I scored somewhere around an 85% on the certification exam, for reasons I'll touch on in the next paragraph.

## The Test

The CC certification exam is composed of 100 multiple-choice questions. You are not allowed to go back to questions at all; you have one chance to answer or skip any given question. I did not know of this beforehand. Otherwise, the certification examination is fairly straightforward - as previously mentioned, there are no performance-based ('lab') questions, and there's no going back.

Many questions are of the "best answer" sort, where two or three plausible solutions are put forth, but one is clearly more relevant or should be considered "best." I expect I picked a few suboptimal answers here. Many of the questions were much broader in scope than those asked in the pre- and post-course assessments provided by ISC² such that I would not say I would be confident passing the exam had I *only* taken the course with no prior experience with cybersecurity, networking or IT. This was sort of a redeeming factor for the CC that made it a bit more than a 'study for a few hours and pass' exam.
