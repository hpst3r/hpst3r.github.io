Cheap planars!

# Introduction

My second pair of Takstar Pro 82 (well, a gaming headset version of them) have a rattly right driver and the strain relief on the cable is no longer relieving strain, so I figured I'd try out some open backs before I tried to fix them (driver swap into my original Pro 82s with blown drivers thanks to a Schiit Magni's death.)

## Reasoning

Planars = good bass
Bass = good
:. planars = good.

I didn't want to spend more than $100 ish on a pair of headphones, and the HE400se are about $110. So I bought the HE400se.

## Comparison Setup

I'm A/Bing these HE400se against a version of the Takstar Pro 82 that are essentially always in the 'bass slider half open' mode, DT770s, and Dynaudio BM10 speakers. Source is Spotify at maximum quality (~320kbps).

The DT770s and Takstars are driven by a Schiit Magni Heresy + Modi 3+ combo. The HE400se and speakers are driven off a Sansui AU-G77XII integrated amp running off the preamp out of the Schiit Magni (I felt like the HE400se sound *A LOT* less tinny  when on the Sansui - its headphone output is fed by the main amp, which is capable of 110wpc/40wpc Class A into 8 ohms if I remember correctly.)

# First Impressions

## Sound Signature

Arguably the most important contributor to a pair of 'good headphones.' I don't like these. They sound hollow. Bass rolls off, highs sound muffled. When I first pulled them out of the box and played Soundgarden's "Burden In My Hand", I wondered why it sounded like I was standing behind Chris Cornell and watching him sing at a wall. An EQ on the low end helps, but anything substantial seemed to make these sound loose and uncontrolled on most older tracks (lower quality masters), which surprised me.

I could never manage to make these sound engaging. EQing them to attempt to raise the low end never made them sound more than flat, and I couldn't get vocals to sound consistently good without some songs becoming shouty or making some voices sound unnaturally boosted.

The vocals, though.. there's no saving the vocals. On *almost* every track I listened to, it sounded as if the vocalist was distant and facing the wrong way.
