## Introduction

Cert #2 down! I took and passed my CC on December 28th, 2023. I spent something like 12-16 solid hours studying (running through the official course's text content, reading the video transcripts, taking notes, and going through a small set of flash cards) over the course of three days. Here's what I think.

## The Course, The Price

The CC is, like the Net+ I took before it, mostly a memorization exercise. The price for me was $0, because of ISC²'s "One Million Certified" program, which, as of the time of writing, offers the official learning material and an exam voucher for free. The learning material was of notably high quality - there was not a single typo within sight. The course is made up of ideos, with PDF transcripts, are included, as are a pre- and post-course assessment (though the assessments were much easier than the actual exam.) There are no 'lab' style questions on the certification exam and there are no 'lab' scenarios in the official prep course. All in all, I'd say that the official course should mostly prepare you for the exam, even if you attempt the CC with no prior knowledge. If this is your first exposure to cybersecurity, I would highly recommend spending extra time going over and beyond the course material to ensure you have a robust understanding of the concepts the CC covers - the exam may throw you some curveballs that were not explicitly covered by the prep course.

All in all, I can't say I disliked the CC. The ISC² website, where the course material is hosted, is inoffensively designed and easy to use, and the course is 1) official and 2) free. I scored a 93% on the pre-course assessment, a 94% on the post-course assessment (brushed up on one or two vocabulary words), and, while you are not given your official score, would conservatively estimate that I scored somewhere around an 85% on the certification exam, for reasons I'll touch on in the next paragraph.

## The Test

The CC certification exam is composed of 100 multiple-choice questions. You are not allowed to go back to questions at all; you have one chance to answer or skip any given question. I realized this on question #10, which was unfortunate, as I'd decided to rush through the test and double-check later. I likely skipped right over the part of the instructions that contained that information in my rush to finish the exam; if I'd known beforehand, this wouldn't have mattered.
