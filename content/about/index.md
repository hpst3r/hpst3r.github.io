### About me

I'm a computer science student and network/Windows admin. I spend my free time as a voluntary Linux herder and amateur stuff-breaker.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, I'm reachable:

### About the site

This site is built with Hugo on GitHub Actions and is hosted on GitHub Pages (the intent was to make it easy to upload things to.)

The theme I'm using is a fork of Lukas Joswiak's [etch](https://github.com/LukasJoswiak/etch). It can be found [here](https://github.com/hpst3r/etch).
