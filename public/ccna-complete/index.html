<p>Took a month and a bit at around ~3 hrs a day, longer than expected because of inefficient study (working on it) and a handful of personal things (stuff happens). Learned a decent amount thanks to hands-on practice (mostly self-made labs in GNS3).</p>
<p>I enjoyed playing with routers and switches much more than just reading about WLC configuration or Cisco SDA. Looking forward to dumping some time into ENARSI study, though that&rsquo;ll probably wait until next year at the earliest (more like &lsquo;in two years, after ENCOR and some work experience&rsquo;) unless networking becomes my &rsquo;thing&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>A weekend off, and then I&rsquo;ll be back to work. Haven&rsquo;t quite decided if I&rsquo;ll pour my time into the RHCSA or AZ-104 next. AZ-104 probably looks better on my entry-level resume, but the RHCSA is more up my alley.</p>
<p>Or I might just play with Ansible for now. Cert studying is taking up time that could be spent learning automation. Not sure how I feel about that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m happy the CCNA isn&rsquo;t dangling over my head anymore. That&rsquo;s it for now.</p>
